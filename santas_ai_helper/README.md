# Santa's AI Helper

_He is making a list and checking it twice, he is going to find out who is naughty or nice!_

This of course means that he is using an ensemble of two deep learning models to classify the children of the world into two categories: naughty or nice.

Santa's AI Helper uses two BERT models and averages their logits to make a final prediction.
